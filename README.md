# Brage templates

This repository contains reusable templates for [Brage](https://github.com/austinbrage/brage), a tool that scaffolds and generates API projects dynamically.

## Purpose

The templates in this repo allow Brage to generate projects with standardized structures, configurations, and best practices. Use these templates to speed up development and ensure consistency across multiple API projects.

# Templates

Currently, the following templates are available:

- **node-express** – A Node API project using the Express framework.
- **golang-gin** – A Go API project using the Gin framework.
